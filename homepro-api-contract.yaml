  description: |
    HomePro Backend API for managing homes, home items, photos, support requests, and users.
    
    ## Architecture
    - **Scala 3.5.0** backend with **Akka HTTP**
    - **PostgreSQL** database with direct SQL queries
    - **Firebase Admin SDK** for authentication
    - **AWS S3** for photo storage with context-based organization
    - **HikariCP** connection pooling
    
    ## Authentication
    All protected endpoints require Firebase JWT token in Authorization header:
    `Authorization: Bearer <firebase-jwt-token>`
    
    ## S3 Storage Structure
    Photos are organized in S3 with context-based paths:
    - Home Item Photos: `{home_item_id}/{filename}`
    - Home Photos: `{home_id}/{filename}`
    - User Photos: `{user_id}/{filename}`
    
    ## Key Features Implemented
    - ✅ Home creation with one-home restriction per user
    - ✅ Home item creation with type validation
    - ✅ Photo upload with S3 integration and database linking
    - ✅ Context-based S3 organization for efficient access
    - ✅ Firebase authentication and authorization
    - ✅ Comprehensive error handling and logging
    - ✅ Support request management
    - ✅ User and home management with JSONB metadata support
    - ✅ CORS support with origin restrictions for security
    - ✅ Delete operations with cascading deletes and proper authorization
    - ✅ S3 cleanup for deleted photos and comprehensive data removal
    
    ## CORS Configuration
    All endpoints support CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) to enable requests from web browsers.
    
    **Supported CORS Headers:**
    - `Access-Control-Allow-Origin:` Restricted to `http://localhost:3000` and `https://home-owners.tech`
    - `Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS`
    - `Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Authorization, Content-Type, X-Requested-With`
    - `Access-Control-Max-Age: 86400` (24 hours preflight cache)
    - `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` (for authenticated requests)
    
    **Preflight Requests:**
    - Browser will send OPTIONS request for complex requests
    - Server responds with appropriate CORS headers
    - Actual request follows if preflight succeeds

      description: |
        Creates a new home for the authenticated user. **Important:** Users are currently 
        restricted to owning only ONE home. If a user already has a home, this endpoint 
        will return a 409 Conflict error.
        
        **Business Rules:**
        - One home per user restriction (will be relaxed in future versions)
        - First home is automatically set as primary (`isPrimary: true`)
        - Creating user is automatically assigned "owner" role
        - Metadata field supports flexible JSONB data for home attributes
        
        **Home Ownership:**
        - Creates both home record and home_owners relationship
        - Assigns "owner" role to creating user
        - Enables full access to home management features

      description: |
        Upload a photo and associate it with a specific home item.
        
        **Upload Flow:**
        1. Client uploads photo via multipart/form-data with form field name `photo`
        2. Photo is uploaded to S3 with context-based path: `{homeItemId}/{filename}`
        3. Photo metadata is stored in database with `homeItemId` association only
        4. Returns presigned URL for immediate photo access
        
        **File Requirements:**
        - Form field name must be: `photo`
        - Supported formats: JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP
        - Recommended max file size: 10MB (configurable on server)
        
        **S3 Storage:**
        - Bucket: `homepro-photos` (configurable)
        - Path: `{homeItemId}/{original-filename}`
        - Database stores only filename (context-based architecture)
        
        **Database Constraint:**
        - Photos must have exactly ONE of: home_id, home_item_id, or user_id set
        - For home item photos, only home_item_id is set
